# Sprinkle Collector

This is a "Simpson's" theme game that generates a random number that is given to the user. There are 4 donuts that are each given randomly generated numbers that the user does not know. The user must click on each donut and accumulate points to match the random number they were given. A match is a win, if the user goes over, that's a loss.
